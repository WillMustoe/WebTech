The main purpose of this webpage is to generate interesting pictures using perlin noise and related basic image filters and interactions.
As it stands the website consists of three pages:
1. Landing page - Links/SVG/CSS/Design Will eventually also funtion as sign in and login pages
2. Create page - This currently houses a basic implementation of perlin noise with a few sliders for altering the generated image
    - Will eventually hold a webgl implementation of perlin noise to improve performance and allow for more layers/particls etc
    - User will then be able to save the images to their account, and share them to the view page
3. View Page - Dynamic/Filterable/Searchable
    - Allows user to view what others have created

I plan to avoid framework use where possible, and implement most features and designs myself. As can be seen there is still a reasonable amount of work to be done
to achieve the above goals.
